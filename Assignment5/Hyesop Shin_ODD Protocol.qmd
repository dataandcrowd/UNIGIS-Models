## Purpose

The purpose of this agent-based model is to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of tree growth and to make a preliminary estimate of tree competitions.

## Entities, state variables and scales

There are two types of agents, the agents and the environment. The agents represent tree seeds while the environment represents a virtual landscape where the seeds grow and distributed.

### Environment

-   Tessellated space

-   100 x 100 grid

### Agents

-   Trees: Tree type A and B

-   Randomly sewed

-   Germinate grow and distribute the same type at a von neumann method

### Representation of Space

-   Nothing
