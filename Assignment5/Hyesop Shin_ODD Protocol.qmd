## How I extended the Eden growth model

-   Creating `is_treeA` and `is_treeB` to germinate the seeds

-   Switch the seedling function

-   Adding competition between tree A and B

## A Summarised ODD Protocol

[The purpose of this agent-based model]{.underline} is to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of tree growth and to make a preliminary estimate of tree competitions. [Specifically, we are addressing the following question]{.underline}: how does trees grow and distribute in the environment in response to tree (nature) competitions.

[The model includes the following entities]{.underline}: trees and land. The state variables and attributes characterising these entities are listed in @tbl-state-variable. The environment is built on a grid of 100 x 100 tessellated patches. Unlike in the real world, seedlings can grow and spread with the same probability in this virtual space. Because it is a closed environment (rather than a taurus), the trees do not spread beyond the boundaries. There are two types of trees in this model (seedlings). I categorised them treeA and treeB for convenience of reference. Both trees are placed in a grid cell at random, but not in the same cell. Since they are seedlings, they are not allowed to move, which means that once they are rooted to the ground, their growth are dependent on the environment. As for the temporal and spatial resolution, a time step in the model represents a year and the simulation stops at the 400th cycle. There is no particular representation for the spatial resolution.

| Name        | Variables                  |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| is_tree     | true / false               |
| is_treeA    | true / false               |
| is_treeB    | true / false               |
| is_seedling | true / false               |
| treeAge     | integer (starts with zero) |
| maxAge      | Somewhere between 80-120   |

[The model's most important processes, which are repeated at each time step,]{.underline} are the updating of germination, growth, tree distribution, and competition with other tree types. Each tree germinates with a 75% chance within 5 years (i.e. cycles in the GAMA platform), and if successful, spreads using the von Neumann neighbourhood method. If tree types A and B overlap, there is a competition between them, but A will win by 70%.

[The model's most important design concepts]{.underline} are seedling competition and ageing. In terms of seedling competition, all cells that do not contain any trees have an equal probability of germination. However, if a tree has already grown in a cell and comes into contact with another tree seedling, we have a competition. Tree A has a 70% chance of beating tree B. When it comes to seedling ageing, if a tree reaches its maximum age, which is a random number between 80 and 120, it dies.

## Results

@fig-map shows the result after the 400th cycle of the simulation. The two seedling types are noticeable, as is the spread, and there are some signs of competition in between. @fig-graph depicts the temporal increase of trees graphically. Up until the 80th step, the increasing trend was very steep. This is when the competition and new germination comes into place. The temporal oscillations of the tree types appear to be similar. At the end of the simulation the number of trees A is 6,396 and the number of trees B is 4,945, where A is approximately 29% higher than B.

Since it was assumed that tree As would win the competition by 30%, tree As won the majority of the repetitions. However, depending on where the initial seedling was planted, the opposite was also observed. As a result, while tree As are statistically proven to have higher tolerance than their competitors, this may not always be the case.
