## The Task

The primary goal of this "Ants" simulation is to comprehend the parameterisation as well as the iterative process utilising '.gaml' codes.

According to the instruction, this simulation only tests the evaporation parameter, which ranges from 1 to 5 by 1 increment.

    Evaporation: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

## How to parameterise in GAMA

In GAMA, simply add an experiment to either visualise the simulation or run it in headless mode. It was only a few lines of code that needed to be changed.

``` javascript
experiment Repeated type: batch repeat: 2 keep_seed: true until: food_remaining <= 0.0 {
        parameter 'Evaporation' var: evaporation_per_cycle min: 1.0 max: 5.0 step: 1.0;
}
```

To export the file, we go all the way up to the `global` section and add the `save_result` section as follows:
```javascript
reflex save_result {
          save ("simu:" +  int(self) + ";evaporation_per_cycle:" + evaporation_per_cycle + 
          ";cycle:"+ cycle + ";food_remaining:" + food_remaining)
               to: "../results/results.txt" type: "text" rewrite: false;
    }
```

## Results

```{r echo=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
result <- read_delim("results/results.txt", delim = ";", col_names = FALSE)

cleaned <- 
  result %>% 
  mutate(
    iteration = result$X1 %>% str_sub(6) %>% as.numeric(),
    evaporation = result$X2 %>% str_sub(23) %>% as.numeric(),
    cycle = result$X3 %>% str_sub(7,10) %>% as.numeric(),
    food_remaining = result$X4 %>% str_sub(16,20) %>% as.numeric()
  ) %>% 
  select(iteration, evaporation, cycle, food_remaining) %>%  # clean variables
  arrange(iteration) %>% 
  ungroup
```


```{r echo=F, message=F}
## averaging the 
cleaned %>% 
  group_by(evaporation, cycle) %>% 
  summarise(food_remaining = mean(food_remaining)) -> cleaned1

cleaned1 %>% 
  mutate(evaporation = as.factor(evaporation)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cycle, y = food_remaining)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = evaporation, colour = evaporation)) 
```


```{r}
cleaned %>% 
  select(-food_remaining) %>% 
  group_by(iteration, evaporation) %>% 
  summarise_all(list(max)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  mutate(iteration = rep(1:10, 5),
         evaporation = as.factor(evaporation)) -> sim_end

sim_end %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = evaporation, y = cycle, fill = evaporation)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~iteration) +
  labs(title = "Ants Model: Time to reach food depletion", subtitle = "by evaporation parameters and iterations") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
